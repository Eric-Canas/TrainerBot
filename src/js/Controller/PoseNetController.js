 * Summary. Manages the loading and estimations of the PoseNet network
 * Description. The PoseNet Controller class charges is in charge of loading the PoseNet model,
 *              from the tensorflowjs hub, and constantly estimate a position for the current
 *              frame of the given videoStream. Additionally, every time a pose is detected,
 *              it executes the set of callbacks passed as argument in the constructor.
